					<h1 >About Me</h1>
					<img class="pull-left" id="mug" src="assets/images/face.jpg" alt=" Alex Z" style="width:300px;height:280px;">

					<p>I’m an aspiring web developer with rich and diverse experiences and life history behind my back. While historical facts may not look best displayed here, some experiences would certainly show and tell who I am and what I’m about. I was born, raised and educated, for the most part, in eastern Europe, Ukraine.  Electronics engineering was my first junior college choice, followed by university degree in Geodesy science. Tech and computer science were always of interest to me, but modern expansion and seemingly endless possibilities of web technologies is what made me finally decide to pursue my passion to the next level.   
					</p>

					<p>Some of the areas of particular interest to me are blockchain applications, education and gaming. Enormous potential of blockchain applications in business,  banking, accounting and governmental affairs, is what is fueling my drive to get involved and perhaps in some small or large way help with creation of tools to combat corruption and great many injustices in developing countries. Having come from one makes it dear to my heart. Education and gaming stem from similar drive to make knowledge more accessible to all seeking it. It’s much easier and fun to learn through clever, well designed game.
